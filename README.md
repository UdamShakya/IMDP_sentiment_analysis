# IMDB Sentiment Analysis – NLP Model 🚀  

This project builds and improves a sentiment analysis model for IMDB reviews using deep learning.  
Each day introduces structured improvements — like a research log.  

---

## 📅 Day 1 – Baseline Sentiment Analysis Model

**Objective:** Build the simplest possible sentiment classifier for IMDB reviews.  

### ✅ Steps Implemented
1. **Data loading (`data_loader.py`)**
   - Downloaded IMDB dataset (25k training, 25k testing).  
   - Reviews already tokenized into integers.  
2. **Preprocessing (`preprocess.py`)**
   - Padded/truncated reviews to fixed length (200 tokens).  
3. **Baseline model (`train.py`)**
   - Architecture: `Embedding → GlobalAveragePooling → Dense → Sigmoid`.  
   - Fast but ignores word order.  
4. **Evaluation (`evaluate.py`)**
   - Tested on validation and test data.  
   - Training curves + bar chart (correct vs incorrect predictions).  

### 📊 Results (Baseline Model)
- Test Accuracy: ~84%  
- Training was quick but model failed on complex sentences (since word order is ignored).

## 📅 Day 2 Progress

- ✅ Added LSTM-based sentiment analysis model (`train_lstm.py`)
- ✅ Added GRU-based sentiment analysis model (`train_gru.py`)
- ✅ Implemented comparison script for LSTM vs GRU (`compare_models.py`)
- ✅ Added early stopping and model checkpointing (`train_lstm.py`)
- ✅ Enhanced evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report (`evaluate.py`)
- ✅ Updated README with results and explanations

### Example Results:
- **LSTM Accuracy:** ~86%
- **GRU Accuracy:** ~85%
- Confusion Matrix + Classification Report available in `/results`

### Next Steps (Day 3):
- Hyperparameter tuning (embedding dim, hidden units, batch size)
- Add word embeddings visualization
- Try bidirectional LSTM

## 📅 Day 3 – Regularization, Monitoring & Embeddings

**Objective:** Improve generalization, add monitoring, and visualize embeddings.  

### ✅ Steps Implemented
1. **Dropout in LSTM (`train_lstm.py`)**
   - Added `Dropout(0.5)` between stacked LSTMs.  
   - Prevents overfitting by randomly disabling neurons.  
2. **Early Stopping + Model Checkpointing**
   - Stops training if validation loss doesn’t improve.  
   - Saves best model weights.  
3. **TensorBoard Logging (`logs/fit/`)**
   - Added TensorBoard callback.  
   - Run locally with:kkkk

     ```bash
     tensorboard --logdir=logs/fit
     ```
     Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view.  
   - TensorBoard shows:
     - Training/validation loss & accuracy  
     - Model graph  
     - Weight/activation histograms  
     - Compare multiple experiments side by side  
4. **Embedding Visualization (`visualize_embeddings.py`)**
   - Extracted embeddings → reduced with t-SNE → plotted 2D map.  
   - Shows semantic clustering of words.  

### 📊 Results (Day 3 Enhancements)
- Dropout stabilized validation accuracy.  
- TensorBoard allowed **experiment comparison**.  
- Embedding visualization showed similar words clustering together.

## 🧭 Project Timeline
- **Day 1:** Simple baseline → proof-of-concept  
- **Day 2:** Advanced sequence models (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM)  
- **Day 3:** Overfitting control + TensorBoard + embeddings

## 📅 Day 4: Advanced Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning

On **Day 4**, we focused on exploring **different hyperparameters** (LSTM units, dropout rates, learning rates, batch sizes) to evaluate their effect on IMDB sentiment classification performance.

### 🔹 What We Did
- Trained **16 different models** with varying hyperparameters.
- Logged training/validation accuracy & loss with **TensorBoard**.
- Applied **EarlyStopping** to prevent overfitting.
- Saved the **best-performing model** automatically.
- Extracted all experiment results into a **CSV file**.
- Visualized outcomes with **training curves** and a **confusion matrix**.

### 📊 Hyperparameter Results
We saved the final validation accuracy/loss for each experiment into a CSV:

### 🔍 Confusion Matrix (Best Model on Test Set)

We also visualized the predictions of the **best model** against the test set:

- **Confusion Matrix**

This matrix shows how many positive/negative reviews were classified correctly vs misclassified.

### 🚀 Key Takeaways
- Models with **128 LSTM units, 0.3 dropout, and learning rate 0.001** achieved the best performance.
- Overfitting was reduced significantly with **dropout + early stopping**.
- TensorBoard allowed us to compare **all 16 experiments visually**.
- CSV + plots make it easier to compare experiments outside of TensorBoard.

## 📊 Day 05 – CNN vs LSTM Comparison

We trained **two deep learning models** on the IMDB dataset:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** – captures local n-gram features.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** – captures long-range dependencies in text.

### 🔹 Results
- CNN achieved ~XX% accuracy.
- LSTM achieved ~YY% accuracy.

## 📅 **Day 06 — Building the Streamlit App**

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from preprocess import preprocess_data

# Load tokenizer and models
MAXLEN = 200
cnn_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("models/cnn_model.h5")
lstm_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("models/lstm_model.h5")

st.title("🎬 IMDB Sentiment Analyzer")
st.write("Interactively predict movie review sentiments using trained models.")

review = st.text_area("Enter your movie review here:")

model_choice = st.selectbox("Choose Model", ["CNN", "LSTM"])

if st.button("Predict Sentiment"):
    from tensorflow.keras.datasets import imdb
    word_index = imdb.get_word_index()
    words = review.lower().split()
    encoded = [word_index.get(w, 2) for w in words]  # 2 = unknown
    padded = pad_sequences([encoded], maxlen=MAXLEN)

    model = cnn_model if model_choice == "CNN" else lstm_model
    prediction = model.predict(padded)[0][0]

    sentiment = "😊 Positive" if prediction > 0.5 else "😞 Negative"
    st.subheader(f"Predicted Sentiment: {sentiment}")
    st.write(f"Confidence: {prediction:.2f}")
